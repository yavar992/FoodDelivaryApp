in the manytomany relation the child entity is not being deletedd automatically or child entity being deleted alone

prolem1 --
Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails (user_roles.user_id)

solution -- my  foreign key on user_roles.user_id had:
ON DELETE RESTRICT
Which means:
❌ You cannot delete a user if they are referenced in the user_roles join table.

✅ The Solution
Change the foreign key on user_roles.user_id to:
ON DELETE CASCADE
